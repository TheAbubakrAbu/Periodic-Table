# Periodic Table Web App

The **Periodic Table Web App** is a web-based application built with JavaScript on Code.org. This project was developed as part of my **AP Computer Science Project** during my **sophomore (10th grade) year in Spring 2022**. It provides an engaging and educational tool for exploring and learning about the periodic table of elements.

## About the Project

The app is designed to make learning about the periodic table interactive and accessible. By offering users the ability to explore element properties, search by atomic number, name, or symbol, and navigate through the periodic table in an intuitive interface, the project helps students and enthusiasts deepen their understanding of chemistry.

### Key Features:
1. **Explore Elements:**
   - Displays detailed information about each of the 118 elements, including:
     - Atomic number
     - Symbol
     - Name
     - Phase at room temperature
     - Type (e.g., metal, non-metal, metalloid)
     - Atomic weight
     - Density, melting point, and boiling point
   - Elements are organized in the app based on their periodic table layout.

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Allows users to search for elements by name, symbol, or atomic number.
   - Supports partial matches and dynamic results to enhance user experience.

3. **Random Element Selection:**
   - A random button to explore a random element, making learning fun and unpredictable.

4. **Page Navigation:**
   - Browse elements across multiple pages for better usability.

## Development Context

This project is part of a broader effort to create accessible and engaging tools for education. Built entirely on **Code.org**, the app leverages JavaScript to manage dynamic interactions, data display, and user input handling. All data for the periodic table elements is hard-coded into the app for offline accessibility and simplicity.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Challenge:** Managing a large dataset of 118 elements.
  - **Solution:** Organizing data into arrays for attributes like atomic numbers, names, and properties, allowing for efficient data retrieval and display.
- **Challenge:** Providing a smooth user experience.
  - **Solution:** Implementing responsive design principles within the Code.org platform and using audio feedback for better interaction.
